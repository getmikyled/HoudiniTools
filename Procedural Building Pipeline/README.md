# Procedural Building Pipeline
#### Problem/Need
Blobs Games' game *Go Cones* features a procedurally generating map. We wanted lots of building variation to increase environmental/atmosphere appeal and replayability.

#### Solution
To rapidly create different buildings, I established a 3D Art Pipeline to **speed up production**.

*Houdini* -> *Substance Painter* -> *Unreal Engine 5*

#### Future Goals
- [ ] Create texture variation for the buildings.

## Example of using Procedural Building Pipeline

## Procedural Building Variation
Building variation that shows what the 3D Art Pipeline is capable of.
